# Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using Python programming language. The game is played between two players, with one player taking X's and the other taking O's. The players take turns to place their symbol on a 3x3 grid, and the first player to get three in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

# Getting Started
To get started with the game, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. Once you have Python installed, you can download the source code for the game and run it on your computer.

# How to Play
To play the game, simply run the Python script tic_tac_toe.py from your terminal or IDE. The game will ask you to input the positions on the grid where you want to place your symbol. The positions are numbered from 1 to 9, starting from the top left corner and going from left to right.

For example, if you want to place your symbol in the top left corner, you would enter the number 1. If you want to place your symbol in the center of the grid, you would enter the number 5.

The game will continue until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

# Game Rules
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Player 1 takes X's and player 2 takes O's.
Players take turns to place their symbol on the grid.
The first player to get three in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
If all the positions on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

# Future Improvements

Add a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the game more visually appealing.
Implement an AI player that can play against the human player.
Allow players to choose their own symbols instead of always using X's and O's.
Add a scoring system to keep track of wins and losses.
Implement a two-player mode that can be played on different computers over the internet.

# Conclusion
The Tic Tac Toe game is a simple but fun game that can be implemented using basic programming concepts. By following the steps above, you can get started playing the game and even customize it to your liking.
